# Intro
The aim of this project is writing a Scheme using Haskell. It follows the [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) Tutorial.

## What is a Scheme?
A Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language.  
You can read more about it [here](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/) or on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)).

# Getting Started
To run the project you should install `ghc` or `ghci`, the interactive haskell environment. 
You can download it from the haskell website: [https://www.haskell.org/downloads/](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/).

After installation you can either run the file `run.sh` or `run.sh --test` just for tests, or edit and recompile the `src/main.hs` file through `ghci`.

To run examples you can follow the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).
